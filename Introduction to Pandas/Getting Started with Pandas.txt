		Getting Started with Pandas
=======================================================================
Installing Pandas
------------------------
=>The first step of working in pandas is to ensure whether it is installed in the system or not.
=>If not then we need to install it in our system using the pip command. 
=>Type the cmd command in the search box and locate the folder using the cd command where python-pip file has been installed. After locating it, type the command:
Syntax:		pip install pandas
--------------------------------
Importing Pandas
--------------------------------
After the pandas have been installed into the system, you need to import the library. This module is generally imported as follows:
	import pandas as pd
=>Here, pd is referred to as an alias to the Pandas. However, it is not necessary to import the library using the alias, it just helps in writing less amount code every time a method or property is called.
